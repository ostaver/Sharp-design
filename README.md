# Sharp Design

Welcome to Sharp Design, a collection of AI agent skills for building professional award-winning websites. Each skill is a self-contained design language — a set of convictions, proportions, and aesthetic rules that an AI agent follows to produce original, high-quality single-page sites. Drop a skill into your agent's context and it builds to spec.

## What is a skill?

A skill is a `SKILL.md` file that lives inside a design language folder. It defines everything the agent needs: layout grammar, component vocabulary, CSS design tokens, JavaScript runtime, and content guidelines. The agent writes all output files from scratch — no templates are copied, no binaries are bundled.

Every build should feel like it belongs to the design language but never look like a clone of a previous build. Variation is intentional and built into each skill.

## Design languages

### Argon
> *Dark, technical, gallery-grade.*

Portfolio-first design language for artists, studios, and creative technologists. Lives at the intersection of a gallery opening and a terminal window. Serif voice, monospace structure, WebGL atmosphere, custom cursor.

- **Style:** Dark, editorial, precision-obsessed
- **Stack:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript · WebGL
- **Tokens:** ~5,000 context tokens
- **Score:** 8.7 / 10
- **Best for:** Artist portfolios, digital studios, creative technologists
- **Result File Type:** .html 

---

### Atelier
> *Minimalist, typographic, craft-obsessed.*

Boutique design language for studio portfolios and landing pages. Warm restraint, serif headlines, ambient motion. Every element earns its place. "We don't decorate; we clarify."

- **Style:** Editorial, elegant, enterprise-ready
- **Stack:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript · WebGL
- **Tokens:** ~4,200 context tokens
- **Score:** 9 / 10
- **Best for:** Studios, agencies, independent makers, craft-driven brands
- **Result File Type:** .html 

---

### Binary
> *Dark, monochrome, pixel-perfect. Resource-Heavy*

Fixed-frame technical reference site. Monospace throughout, live WebGL fragment shader hero, percentage loader, CSS glitch image effects, giant footer wordmark, custom cursor, scroll-reveal motion. Everything is fetched from CDNs or written inline — four plain text files, nothing else.

- **Style:** Instrument panel, dark, programmer-grade
- **Stack:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript · WebGL (GLSL) · Node.js
- **External:** Google Fonts · Lucide Icons · Unsplash
- **Tokens:** ~18,600 context tokens
- **Score:** 9.6 / 10
- **Best for:** Technical products, developer tools, SaaS, reference sites
- **Result File Type:** Repository/Folder

## Comparison

| | Argon | Atelier | Binary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aesthetic | Gallery / terminal | Editorial / warm | Instrument / cold |
| Type voice | Serif + mono | Serif + sans | Mono only |
| Hero | WebGL backdrop | Ambient motion | WebGL GLSL shader |
| Cursor | Custom | Custom | Custom |
| Complexity | Medium | Low–Medium | High |
| Token cost | ~5 k | ~4.2 k | ~18.6 k |
| Result | Single `.html` file | Single `.html` file | Folder (4 text files) |

> **Zero binary assets** — all three skills produce sites with no local fonts, images, or prebuilt bundles stored on disk. Fonts come from Google Fonts, icons from Lucide CDN, images from Unsplash. The output is pure text (HTML, CSS, JS) that you can read, diff, and version control like any other code.

## Using a skill

1. Open your AI agent (Claude, GPT-5, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc.)
2. Paste the contents of the `SKILL.md` file into the system prompt or as a context file
3. Tell the agent what you want to build — brand, copy, section ideas
4. The agent produces all output files; you run them locally or deploy as-is

> **Tip for Binary:** Because it includes a folder structure, it is advised to use an AI Agent, integrated into the local system.
> **Example prompt for a skill:** Create a website about AI and machine learning. Use the skill "Argon", 6 sections. Unique and creative website.


### Recommended models

Most skills work well with:
- Claude (Sonnet / Opus)
- DeepSeek
- GPT /Codex (superior tiers)
- Qwen (superior tiers)
- Kimi K2
- GLM / Z.ai
- Grok

Avoid for all skills: Mistral, Meta/Llama, and other smaller open-weight models.

Each design language lives in its own folder. `About.md` is for humans — model compatibility, token cost, score, notes. `SKILL.md` is for the agent.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — new design languages, improvements to existing skills, fixes, and documentation.

### Adding a new design language

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch: `git checkout -b language/your-language-name`
2. Create a folder: `YourLanguage/your-language-skill/SKILL.md`
3. Add an `About.md` in the top-level language folder following the existing format (model compatibility, token count, word count, character count, score, description)
4. Include at least one preview image in the language folder if possible
5. Open a pull request with a short description of the aesthetic and what makes it distinct from existing styles/skills

**A new language must:**
- Have a clear, named aesthetic conviction (not just "a clean site")
- Produce original output on every run — not a fixed template
- Be fully standalone (no local binaries, no private CDNs)
- Include a complete `SKILL.md` with layout grammar, component spec, and a runtime implementation

### Improving an existing skill

- **Bug fixes** (broken CSS, JS errors, incorrect CDN URLs) — open a PR directly with a clear description
- **Improvements** (better compression, new variation presets, additional section types) — open an issue first to discuss, then PR
- **Model compatibility updates** — if you find a model produces notably good or bad results with a skill, update the `About.md` and note it in the PR

### Style guidelines

- Keep `SKILL.md` files self-contained — an agent should be able to build a complete site from the file alone, with no outside context
- Prefer compression over verbosity: fewer tokens, clearer instructions
- Do not introduce external API dependencies, authentication, or server-side logic into a skill
- All CDN resources must be from well-known, public hosts (`fonts.googleapis.com`, `unpkg.com`, `images.unsplash.com`, etc.)

### Pull request checklist

- [ ] `SKILL.md` produces a working site when given to a recommended model
- [ ] `About.md` is filled in (token count, word count, character count, model compatibility, score)
- [ ] No binary assets committed (`.woff2`, `.png` previews are the only exception)
- [ ] CDN URLs in examples have been verified as live
- [ ] Branch name follows `language/name` or `fix/description` or `improve/language-name`

### Opening issues

Use issues for:
- Reporting a broken skill (model, prompt used, and observed output help a lot)
- Proposing a new design language concept
- Discussing significant changes to an existing language's grammar
